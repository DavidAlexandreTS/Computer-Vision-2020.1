# Computer Vision â€“ 2020.1

This repository contains practical assignments and projects developed during my **Computer Vision course** taken in the first semester of 2020.

## Course Overview

Throughout the course, I explored and implemented the **fundamental techniques of Computer Vision and Machine Learning**, focusing on both theoretical understanding and hands-on application. The activities involved classic image processing, feature extraction, and model-based approaches to visual recognition tasks.

## Topics Covered:
- Image filtering and transformations
- Edge detection and morphological operations
- Feature detection and matching (e.g., SIFT, ORB)
- Object detection and tracking
- Image classification using traditional ML algorithms
- Introduction to convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
- Evaluation metrics for computer vision models

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Highlights
This course helped solidify my knowledge in key areas of computer vision while providing a strong foundation for more advanced topics such as deep learning, object recognition, and real-time visual systems.
